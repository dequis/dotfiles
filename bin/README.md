Small scripts and shell scripts I wrote

* asd: Returns a placeholder word selected from an english dictionary filtered to pick easy to remember words. Also saves it to the X clipboard.
* namehash: generates 5 character filenames that hold a portion of the file md5 hash
* zxc: uploads to dump.dequis.org using filenames returned by namehash
* scr: takes a screenshot and uploads it using zxc. uses [escrotum](https://github.com/Roger/escrotum) instead of scrot
* lsr: list N most recent files, where N is the first argument. wraps ls mostly transparently

tmux related scripts are in tmux/bin/ in this repo
