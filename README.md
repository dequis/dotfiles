This is a git repository for my bash history, my ssh private keys, and my vipcoin wallet

There's also a bunch of potentially useful scripts:

 * `./bin/` - general purpose scripts
 * `./bfg/` - bfgminer scripts (not using these anymore)
 * `./tmux/bin/` - tmux related scripts / extended commands

FUN FACT: none of the filenames in this repo start with dots (.git doesn't count)
