# st config

st is [simple terminal](http://st.suckless.org/)

Interesting stuff here:

 * Spoilertext patch - if background and foreground are the same, selected text will appear as if it was white on black. Created against git cdb3b189 (2014-02-01)
 * The delete key works everywhere. The st FAQ has an entry for "Why doesnâ€™t the Del key work in some programs?". It blames the programs and tells you to fix all of them individually. Fuck that.
 * Added LockMask to ignoremod to ignore caps lock too
 * Keybindings for ctrl-shift-left/right
 * Right click / control right click send `` `#`` and `` `@`` which are my tmux split window commands. I don't actually use this but I think it's a neat idea.

Might be worth noting that this config is much closer to the defaults than the urxvt one, most stuff worked out of the box.
